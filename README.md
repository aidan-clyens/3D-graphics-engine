# 3D Graphics Engine

A modular, component-based 3D game engine built with modern C++ and OpenGL, featuring an Entity-Component-System architecture, physics simulation, and advanced rendering capabilities.

## Overview

This project implements a custom 3D graphics engine designed for real-time rendering and interactive applications. The engine provides a flexible framework for building 3D games and simulations with support for physics, lighting, shadows, model loading, and custom shader pipelines.

## Architecture

### Core Design Patterns

**Entity-Component-System (ECS)**
- Decoupled architecture separating data (Components) from behavior (Systems)
- Entities act as containers for Components, enabling flexible object composition
- Component types: Mesh, Rigidbody, Camera, Light, Model
- EntityManager coordinates component lifecycle and inter-system communication

**Rendering Pipeline**
- Forward rendering with shadow mapping
- Depth texture generation for dynamic shadows
- Multi-pass rendering: shadow pass → geometry pass
- Skybox rendering with cube mapping
- Support for both solid colors and texture-based materials

**Physics Integration**
- Bullet Physics integration for rigid body dynamics
- Collision detection and response
- Configurable mass and dynamic/static body types
- Transform synchronization between physics and rendering systems

## Technical Features

## Key Classes

### Engine
Main engine class inheriting from `EntityManager`. Manages the game loop, rendering, physics updates, and object lifecycle.

### Renderer
Handles all OpenGL rendering operations, shader management, shadow mapping, and framebuffer configuration.

### Object3D
Scene graph node representing any object in 3D space. Inherits from `Entity` to support component attachment.

### Component System
- `Mesh`: Geometric data and rendering properties
- `Rigidbody`: Physics simulation properties
- `Camera`: View and projection matrices
- `Light`: Lighting parameters (Point/Directional)
- `Model`: 3D model loaded from file

## Performance Characteristics

- **Delta-time based updates** for frame-rate independent simulation
- **Instanced rendering support** for efficient batch rendering
- **Depth pre-pass** for shadow optimization
- **Component caching** to minimize lookups

## Design Decisions

### Component-Based Architecture
The ECS pattern was chosen to maximize code reusability and flexibility. Objects are composed of orthogonal components rather than rigid class hierarchies, enabling easier feature combination and modification.

### Bullet Physics Integration
Bullet was selected for its maturity, performance, and comprehensive feature set. The integration maintains separation between rendering and simulation through transform synchronization.

### Forward Rendering
Despite being less scalable than deferred rendering for many lights, forward rendering was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness for the target use cases (small to medium scenes with limited light sources).

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- Deferred rendering pipeline for improved lighting scalability
- Post-processing effects (bloom, HDR, SSAO)
- Particle systems
- Skeletal animation support
- Audio system integration
- Scene serialization/deserialization
- Multi-threading for physics and rendering
